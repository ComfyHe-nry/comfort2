# Question 2: Discuss at least six web3 characteristics in your understanding.

1. Decentralization of data:
   With web3, power is not concentrated with central corporate authorities, but instead is held by decentralized entities. Content creators can monetize their data without any central authority.

2. Artificial Intelligence:
   Web3, with the help of natural language processing technologies, enables devices to understand information just like humans.

3. Trustless and permissionless controls and environments:
   Web3 software will be trustless, meaning users can access it without requiring permission from any governing body.

4. Use of blockchain and smart contract technologies:
   Web3 emerged from the advent of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Smart contracts on the blockchain enable ownership transfers without the need for central control or intermediaries.

5. Ubiquitous IoT and edge connectivity:
   Edge computing is a foundational technology for web3, enabling support for data-heavy immersive experiences including video, AI, augmented reality, and virtual reality.

6. Decentralization of governance:
   Decentralization is a core characteristic and important concept of web3. Power is not concentrated in central authorities but instead held by decentralized autonomous organizations.

These are just a few characteristics of web3, and there are likely many more emerging as the technology evolves.
